# algorithm-vault: Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository provides Python implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures as studied in university-level courses. It is organized into various categories, each focusing on specific types of algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

### Static Data Structures
- **Queue**: Implements a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
- **Stack**: Implements a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.

### Lists
- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where each element points to the next node in the sequence.
- **Doubly Linked List**: An extension of the linked list with nodes that point to both the next and previous nodes.
- **Circular Linked List**: A linked list where the last node points back to the first node.
- **Circular Doubly Linked List**: A combination of doubly linked list and circular linked list, where the last node points to the first node and each node points to both the next and previous nodes.

### Priority Queue
- **Heap**: A binary tree-based data structure that maintains the heap property, either max-heap or min-heap.
- **D-ary Heap**: A generalization of a binary heap where each node has `d` children.

### String Algorithms
- **Searching**
  - **Naive**: A straightforward substring search algorithm.
  - **Boyer-Moore-Horspool (BMH)**: An efficient string search algorithm that skips unnecessary comparisons using heuristics.
  - **Knut-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**: An efficient search algorithm utilizing a partial match table to avoid redundant comparisons.

- **Similarity**
  - **Hamming Distance**: Measures the number of positions at which two strings of equal length differ.
  - **Levenshtein Distance**
    - **Using Bottom Up**: Computes the minimum number of edit operations required to transform one string into another using dynamic programming.
    - **Using Top Down**: An alternative approach to compute the Levenshtein distance using memoization.

- **Compression**
  - **Huffman Compression**: A lossless compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies.

### Trees
- **Binary Tree**: A hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children.
- **Restore Trees**: Algorithm to reconstruct binary trees from given preorder and inorder traversals.
- **Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree where each nodeâ€™s left child contains a value less than the node, and the right child contains a value greater.
- **Segment Tree**: A data structure that allows efficient querying and updating of intervals or segments.
- **Trie**: A tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys in a set of strings.

### Graphs
- **Graph Representation**: Includes implementations for adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations.
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: A traversal algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: A traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Best-First Search**: A search algorithm that uses heuristics to prioritize nodes towards the goal.
- **A-Star Search (A\*)**: An informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node using a heuristic function.
- **Knights Tour Problem**: A problem where the objective is to move a knight on a chessboard to visit each square exactly once.
- **N Queens Problem**: A problem where the objective is to place `n` queens on a chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.
- **Union Find**: A data structure for tracking and merging disjoint sets.
- **Minimum Spanning Trees**
  - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph by sorting and adding edges based on their weights.
  - **Prim's Algorithm**: Constructs a minimum spanning tree by expanding the tree from an initial vertex.
